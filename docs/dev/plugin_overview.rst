Overview
********

`stoQ` is a highly flexible framework because of its ability to leverage plugins for each
layer of operations. One of the biggest benefits to this approach is that it ensures the
user is able to quickly and easily pivot to and from different technologies in their stack,
without having to drastically alter workflow. To better understand the `stoQ` workflow and
how each of the below plugins are used, check out the :ref:`stoQ workflow section <workflow>`.

For a full listing of all publicly available plugins, check out the `stoQ public plugins <https://github.com/PUNCH-Cyber/stoq-plugins-public>`_ repository.
